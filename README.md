  # ${1:Tensorphone}
The purpose of this project is to develop an android app that can recognize the sounds of teeth grinding. The model is pre-trained using a convolutional network with Tensorflow's python api, the code is provided in Bruxism_tensorboard.ipynb, the raw .wav files can be downloaded from the dropbox [link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/e6x6emcvggx69nl/AADiigi8h_fbonUwJ9dy-Rc3a?dl=0). Each .wav file is labeled with 1 second segments of teethgrinding. In addition.
